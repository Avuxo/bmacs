bmax scripting
==============

The bmax scripting language uses simple 1 character commands to headlessly communicate with the bmacs text editor.
bmax scripts typically end in the .bmax file extension. use the -h flag to start bmacs in headless mode

>x (move gap right x chars -- x is an integer)
<x (move gap left x chars -- x is an integer)
^c (insert char at current point -- c is a char)
[x (COMMAND)] (repeat COMMAND x times - x is an integer)
$ register 1 (int)
& register 2 (int)
# register 3 (char)
=xn  assign register value (where x is a register of any kind, and n is a type in correlation with the type of register)
; done assigning register
~x~ comment (where x is anything)
. print out current buffer (logmode)
+x increment current integer register (where x is an integer register)
-x decrement current integer register (where x is an integer register)
